The TL;DR is that 404 Media is taking the week off, so this is the only email you\\u2019ll get from us this week. No posts on the website (except a scheduled one for the podcast). We will be back with your regularly scheduled dystopia Monday, July 7.&nbsp;</p><p>We\u2019re doing this to take a quick break to recharge. Over the nearly two years since we founded 404 Media, each of us have individually taken some (very limited) vacations. And when one of us takes off time it just means that the others have to carry their workload. We\u2019re not taking this time to do an offsite, or brainstorm blue sky ideas. Some of us are quite literally gone fishin\u2019. So, for the first time ever: A break!</p><p>We are not used to breaks, because we know that the best way to build an audience and a business of people who read our articles is to actually write a lot of articles, and so that\u2019s what we\u2019ve been doing. The last few months have been particularly wild, as we\u2019ve covered <a href=\"https://www.404media.co/former-heritage-foundation-staffer-orders-treasury-employees-to-respond-to-elon-musks-email/\"><u>Elon Musk\u2019s</u></a> <a href=\"https://www.404media.co/ai-video-of-trump-sucking-musks-toes-blasted-on-government-office-tvs/\"><u>takeover</u></a> of the <a href=\"https://www.404media.co/elon-musks-waste-gov-is-just-a-wordpress-theme-placeholder-page/\"><u>federal government</u></a>, the <a href=\"https://www.404media.co/flock-removes-states-from-national-lookup-tool-after-ice-and-abortion-searches-revealed/\"><u>creeping</u></a> <a href=\"https://www.404media.co/emails-reveal-the-casual-surveillance-alliance-between-ice-and-local-police/\"><u>surveillance</u></a> <a href=\"https://www.404media.co/the-200-sites-an-ice-surveillance-contractor-is-monitoring/\"><u>state</u></a>, Trump\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.404media.co/meta-is-laying-the-narrative-groundwork-for-trumps-mass-deportations-2/\"><u>mass</u></a> <a href=\"https://www.404media.co/ice-just-paid-palantir-tens-of-millions-for-complete-target-analysis-of-known-populations/\"><u>deportation</u></a> <a href=\"https://www.404media.co/ice-cbp-secret-service-all-broke-law-with-smartphone-location-data/\"><u>campaign</u></a>, AI\u2019s role in <a href=\"https://www.404media.co/amazons-ai-warehouses-isolate-workers-impact-union-organizing-new-report-finds/\"><u>stomping</u></a> <a href=\"https://www.404media.co/linkedin-ai-coworkers-marketeam-open-to-work/\"><u>over</u></a> <a href=\"https://www.404media.co/anthropic-claude-job-application-ai-assistants/\"><u>workers</u></a>, the general <a href=\"https://www.404media.co/ai-scraping-bots-are-breaking-open-libraries-archives-and-museums/\"><u>destruction</u></a> of the internet, etc etc etc. At the moment we have more story leads than we can possibly get to and are excited for the second half of the year. We\u2019ve also published a lot of hopeful news, too, including instances where people <a href=\"https://www.404media.co/nurses-protest-ai-automation/\"><u>fight back</u></a> against <a href=\"https://www.404media.co/archivists-work-to-identify-and-save-the-thousands-of-datasets-disappearing-from-data-gov/\"><u>powerful forces</u></a> or <a href=\"https://www.404media.co/one-of-the-universes-biggest-mysteries-has-been-solved-scientists-say/\"><u>solve universal mysteries</u></a>, or when companies are forced to <a href=\"https://www.404media.co/civitai-ban-of-real-people-content-deals-major-blow-to-the-nonconsensual-ai-porn-ecosystem/\"><u>do the right thing</u></a> in response to our reporting, or when lawmakers hold tech giants <a href=\"https://www.404media.co/senators-letter-demand-meta-answer-for-ai-chatbots-posing-as-licensed-therapists/\"><u>to account</u></a> as a result of <a href=\"https://www.404media.co/senator-demands-investigation-into-trump-admin-signal-clone-after-404-media-investigation/\"><u>our investigations</u></a>. But in an industry that has become obsessed with doing more with less and publishing constantly, we have found that publishing quality journalism you can\u2019t find anywhere else is a good way to run a business, which means we thankfully don\u2019t have to cover everything, everywhere, all at once.</p><p>When we founded 404 Media <a href=\"https://www.404media.co/welcome-to-404-media/\"><u>in August 2023</u></a>, we had no idea if anyone would subscribe, and we had no idea how it would go. We took zero investment from anyone and hoped that if we did good work often enough, enough people would decide that they wanted to support independent journalism that we could make a job out of it, and that we could make a sustainable business that would work for the long haul. We did not and do not take that support for granted. But because of your support, we now feel like we don\u2019t have to scratch and claw for every possible new dollar we can get, and you have given us the breathing room in our business to quite literally take a breather, and to let the other folks who make this website possible, such as those who help us out with our social accounts, take a paid breather as well.&nbsp;</p><p>And if you want to subscribe to support our work, you <a href=\"https://www.404media.co/membership\" rel=\"noreferrer\">can do so here</a>.</p><p>We are not tired, exactly. In fact, we all feel more energized and ambitious than ever, knowing there are so many people out there who enjoy our work and are willing to financially support it. But we also don\u2019t want to burn ourselves out and therefore, school\u2019s out for summer (for one week). This week\u2019s podcast is an interview Jason recorded with our friend Casey Johnston a few weeks ago; it\u2019ll be the only new content this week. We\u2019ll be back to it next Monday. Again, thank you all.&nbsp;Also, if you want, open thread in the comments to chat about whatever is going on out there or whatever is on your mind.</p>","url":"https://www.404media.co/introducing-404-media-summer-break-2025/","extracted_content_url":"https://extract.feedbin.com/parser/feedbin/0629180d9d469baabd55107c98c34872f9da939e?base64_url=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuNDA0bWVkaWEuY28vaW50cm9kdWNpbmctNDA0LW1lZGlhLXN1bW1lci1icmVhay0yMDI1Lw==","published":"2025-06-30T13:00:21.000000Z","created_at":"2025-06-30T13:32:50.582013Z"}]

          "content": "<p>Spotlight, the current search feature in macOS, does far more than find locally stored files, but in this brief history I focus on that function, and how it has evolved as Macs have come to keep increasingly large numbers of files.</p>\n<p>Until early Macs had enough storage to make this worthwhile, there seemed little need. Although in 1994 there were precious few Macs with hard disks as large as 1 GB, networks could provide considerably more. That year Apple offered its first product in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AppleSearch\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">AppleSearch</a>, based on a client-server system running over AppleShare networks, and in its Workgroup Servers in particular. This was a pioneering product that was soon accompanied by a local app, Find File, written by Bill Monk and introduced in System 7.5 that September.</p>\n<h4>Sherlock</h4>\n<p>The next step was to implement a similar architecture to AppleSearch on each Mac, with a service that maintained indexes of file metadata and contents, and a client that passed queries to it. This became <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sherlock_(software)\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Sherlock</a>, first released in Mac OS 8.5 in 1998. As access to the web grew, this came to encompass remote search through plug-ins that worked with web search engines.</p>\n<p><span><a href=\"https://eclecticlight.co/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/sherlock22000.jpg\"><img data-attachment-id=\"86761\" data-permalink=\"https://eclecticlight.co/2025/06/07/a-brief-history-of-local-search/sherlock22000/\" data-orig-file=\"https://eclecticlight.co/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/sherlock22000.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"1280,960\" data-comments-opened=\"0\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"Sherlock22000\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://eclecticlight.co/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/sherlock22000.jpg?w=300\" data-large-file=\"https://eclecticlight.co/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/sherlock22000.jpg?w=940\" src=\"https://eclecticlight.co/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/sherlock22000.jpg\" width=\"940\" height=\"705\"></a></span></p>\n<p>Those were expanded in Sherlock 2, part of Mac OS 9.0 from 1999 and shown above, and version 3 that came in Mac OS X 10.2 Jaguar in 2002. The latter brought one of the more unseemly conflicts in Apple\u2019s history, when developers at Karelia claimed Sherlock 3 had plagiarised its own product, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karelia_Watson\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Watson</a>, which in turn had been modelled on Sherlock. Apple denied that, but the phrase <em>being Sherlocked</em> has passed into the language as a result.</p>\n<h4>Spotlight</h4>\n<p>Sherlock remained popular with the introduction of Mac OS X, but was never ported to run native on Intel processors. Instead, Apple replaced it with Spotlight in Mac OS X 10.4 Tiger, in April 2005.</p>\n<p><span><a href=\"https://eclecticlight.co/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/spotlight2005.jpg\"><img data-attachment-id=\"86762\" data-permalink=\"https://eclecticlight.co/2025/06/07/a-brief-history-of-local-search/spotlight2005/\" data-orig-file=\"https://eclecticlight.co/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/spotlight2005.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"1600,1200\" data-comments-opened=\"0\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"spotlight2005\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://eclecticlight.co/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/spotlight2005.jpg?w=300\" data-large-file=\"https://eclecticlight.co/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/spotlight2005.jpg?w=940\" src=\"https://eclecticlight.co/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/spotlight2005.jpg\" width=\"940\" height=\"705\"></a></span></p>\n<p>Initially, the Spotlight menu command dropped down a search panel as shown here, rather than opening a window as it does now.</p>\n<p><span><a href=\"https://eclecticlight.co/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/spotlight2006.jpg\"><img data-attachment-id=\"86763\" data-permalink=\"https://eclecticlight.co/2025/06/07/a-brief-history-of-local-search/spotlight2006/\" data-orig-file=\"https://eclecticlight.co/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/spotlight2006.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"1600,1200\" data-comments-opened=\"0\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"Spotlight2006\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://eclecticlight.co/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/spotlight2006.jpg?w=300\" data-large-file=\"https://eclecticlight.co/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/spotlight2006.jpg?w=940\" src=\"https://eclecticlight.co/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/spotlight2006.jpg\" width=\"940\" height=\"705\"></a></span></p>\n<p>A Finder search window, precursor to the modern Find window, is shown in the lower left of this screenshot taken from Tiger in 2006.</p>\n<p>Spotlight was improved again in Mac OS 10.5 Leopard, in 2007.

Those are maintained by <code>mdworker</code> processes relying on <code>mdimporter</code> plugins to provide tailored access for different file types. If an mdimporter fails to provide content data on some or all of the file types it supports, those are missing from that volume\u2019s indexes, and Spotlight search will be unsuccessful. This happened most probably in macOS Catalina 10.15.6, breaking the <a href=\"https://eclecticlight.co/2021/02/15/full-release-of-mints-1-0-is-now-available-and-diagnoses-big-surs-spotlight-bug/\">indexing of content</a> from Rich Text files. That wasn\u2019t fixed until macOS Big Sur 11.3 in April 2021.</p>\n<p>Over the last few years, macOS has gained the ability to perform optical character recognition using Live Text, and to analyse and classify images. Text and metadata retrieved by the various services responsible are now included in Spotlight\u2019s indexes. From macOS 13 Ventura in 2022, those services can take prolonged periods working through images and file types like PDF that include images they can process to generate additional content and metadata for indexing.</p>\n<p>Those with large collections of eligible files have noticed sustained workloads as a result. Fortunately for those with Apple silicon Macs, those services, like Spotlight\u2019s indexing, run almost exclusively on their Mac\u2019s E cores, so have little or no effect on its ability to run apps. For those with Intel processors, though, this may continue to be troubling.</p>\n<p>In less than 30 years, searching Macs has progressed from the basic Find File to Spotlight finding search terms in text recognised in photos, in almost complete silence. Even Spotlight\u2019s 20th birthday passed just over a month ago, on 29 April, without so much as an acknowledgment of its impact.</p>",

That's what made Jaeger-LeCoultre's Beverly Hills Boutique, which is now home to a curated selection of novelties and rare heritage timepieces from the august Swiss brand, the perfect location for the latest edition of UBS House of Craft. <strong>This installment of UBS House of Craft</strong> brought together Anne-Laure Ritter, President of Jaeger-LeCoultre Americas, Hodinkee editor Rich Fordon, and a select group of UBS guests and Hodinkee community members for an evening of creativity, craftsmanship, and spectacular watches.</p>\n  \t  <figure>\n    <img src=\"https://hodinkee.imgix.net/uploads/images/eaf4d938-4136-4afb-9c82-297461cef50e/HODINKEEXJeager-LeCoultreFINALS-2.JPG?ixlib=rails-1.1.0&amp;fm=jpg&amp;q=55&amp;auto=format&amp;usm=12&amp;ch=Width%2CDPR%2CSave-Data&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=2000\">\n    <figcaption></figcaption>\n  </figure>\n  <figure>\n    <img src=\"https://hodinkee.imgix.net/uploads/images/b8a37bf1-4fcf-4f33-9d7f-42f97b8e4cfc/HODINKEEXJeager-LeCoultreFINALS-14.JPG?ixlib=rails-1.1.0&amp;fm=jpg&amp;q=55&amp;auto=format&amp;usm=12&amp;ch=Width%2CDPR%2CSave-Data&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=2000\">\n    <figcaption></figcaption>\n  </figure>\n  <figure>\n    <img src=\"https://hodinkee.imgix.net/uploads/images/7a23da62-dd98-4634-8241-349c74f3c8e2/HODINKEEXJeager-LeCoultreFINALS-20.JPG?ixlib=rails-1.1.0&amp;fm=jpg&amp;q=55&amp;auto=format&amp;usm=12&amp;ch=Width%2CDPR%2CSave-Data&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=2000\">\n    <figcaption></figcaption>\n  </figure>\n  <figure>\n    <img src=\"https://hodinkee.imgix.net/uploads/images/77819398-6e20-4951-88ab-5611c95e1ae4/HODINKEEXJeager-LeCoultreFINALS-10.JPG?ixlib=rails-1.1.0&amp;fm=jpg&amp;q=55&amp;auto=format&amp;usm=12&amp;ch=Width%2CDPR%2CSave-Data&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=2000\">\n    <figcaption></figcaption>\n  </figure>\n\n  \t<p>The Beverly Hills Jaeger-LeCoultre boutique on Rodeo Drive is always a good place to see beautiful examples of <i>haute horlogerie</i>, but thanks to the recent arrival of the 1931 Polo Club Traveling Collection, there was more to admire than usual. Guests sipped cocktails and perused the latest volume of <i>Hodinkee</i> magazine while discovering this traveling exhibit of <a href=\"https://www.hodinkee.com/videos/inside-the-history-and-archives-of-the-jaeger-lecoultre-reverso\" target=\"_blank\">Jaeger-LeCoultre Reverso </a>timepieces, which included both rare archival pieces and the brand's latest novelties from Watches &amp; Wonders Geneva. From its origins on the polo pitches of the 1930s to its latter-day status among the icons of modern watchmaking, the exhibit explores the Reverso's fascinating evolution over the last century. A Jaeger-LeCoultre watchmaker was also on hand to offer technical insights into spectacular modern creations like the Reverso Tribute Minute Repeater and Reverso Tribute Geographic.</p>\n  \t<figure>\n  <img src=\"https://hodinkee.imgix.net/uploads/images/a07df82e-d8e2-439b-ac81-cea808e5eaa7/HODINKEEXJeager-LeCoultreFINALSretouched-2.JPG?ixlib=rails-1.1.0&amp;fm=jpg&amp;q=55&amp;auto=format&amp;usm=12&amp;ch=Width%2CDPR%2CSave-Data&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=2000\">\n  <figcaption></figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n  \t<figure>\n  <img src=\"https://hodinkee.imgix.net/uploads/images/56354fdd-9f5a-4503-98dd-3bf390e870fc/HODINKEEXJeager-LeCoultreFINALS-39.JPG?ixlib=rails-1.1.0&amp;fm=jpg&amp;q=55&amp;auto=format&amp;usm=12&amp;ch=Width%2CDPR%2CSave-Data&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=2000\">\n  <figcaption></figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n  \t<p>After having an opportunity to experience these pieces in the metal, guests were treated to a wide-ranging conversation between Ritter and Fordon. Among the many topics discussed were the legacy of the Reverso as the world's first sports watch and the skilled crafts that go into creating novelties like the Reverso Tribute Nonantieme 'Enamel' and the Reverso One Precious Flowers. In keeping with the theme of the UBS House of Craft, Ritter had much to say on the topic of creativity and craft, detailing the brand's emphasis on artistic crafts through its Atelier des M\u00e9tiers Rares, as well as its ongoing efforts to share this know-how through the Atelier d'Antoine series of watchmaking classes. As one of Switzerland's most respected manufactures, with over 1,400 calibres, 430 patents, and nearly 200 years of heritage to its name, these examples left little doubt about Jaeger-LeCoultre's longstanding commitment to traditional <i>savoir-faire</i>.</p>\n  \t<p>For those looking to take their interest in watches to the next level with a hands-on watchmaking experience, invitations to Jaeger-LeCoultre's <strong>masterclasses with their in-house watchmaker</strong> &nbsp;were extended to guests. From seasoned collectors to those just beginning their journey in the world of fine watchmaking, there was much to discover at this edition of UBS House of Craft. In addition to providing expert insights and historical details, it demonstrated the ways in which traditional craftsmanship is essential to creating something truly timeless.</p>\n  \t<figure>\n

          "content": "<p>Over the weekend, Elon Musk shared Grok altered photographs of people walking through the interior of instruments and implied that his AI system had created the beautiful and surreal images. But the underlying photos are the work of artist Charles Brooks, who wasn\u2019t credited when Musk <a href=\"https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1929031204646302129\"><u>shared the images</u></a> with his 220 million followers.</p><p>Musk drives a lot of attention to anything he talks about online and that can be a boon for artists and writers, but only if they\u2019re credited and Musk isn\u2019t big on sharing credit. This all began when X user Eric Jiang posted a picture of Brook\u2019s instrument interior photographs Jiang had run through Grok. He\u2019d use the AI to add people to the artist\u2019s original photos and make the instrument interiors look like buildings. Musk then retweeted Jiang\u2019s post, adding \u201cGenerate images with @Grok.\u201d</p><p>Neither Musk or Jiang credited Brooks as the creator of the original photos, though Jiang added his name in a reply to his initial post.</p><p>Brooks told 404 Media that he isn\u2019t on X a lot these days and learned about the posts when someone else told him. \u201cI got notified by someone else that Musk had tweeted my photos saying they\u2019re AI,\u201d he said. \u201cFirst there\u2019s kind of rage. You\u2019re thinking, \u2018Hey, he\u2019s using my photos to promote his system. Quickly it becomes murky. These photos have been edited by someone else [\u2026] he\u2019s lifted my photos from somewhere else [\u2026] and he\u2019s run them through Grok\u2014and this is the main thing to me\u2014he\u2019s edited a tiny percentage of them and then he\u2019s posted them saying, \u2018Look at these tiny people inside instruments.\u2019 And in that post he hasn\u2019t mentioned my name. He puts it as a comment.\u201d</p><p>Brooks is a former concert cellist turned photographer in Australia who is most famous for his work photographing the inside of famous instruments. Using specialized techniques he\u2019s developed using medical equipment like endoscopes, he enters violins, pianos, and organs and transforms their interiors into beautiful photographs. Through his lens, a <a href=\"https://www.architectureinmusic.com/en-us/collections/the-exquisite-architecture-of-steinway-part-5\"><u>Steinway piano</u></a> becomes an airport terminal carved from wood and the St. Mark's pipe organ in Philadelphia becomes an <a href=\"https://www.architectureinmusic.com/en-us/collections/st-marks-pipe-organ-part-1\"><u>eerie steel forest</u></a>. Jiang\u2019s Grok-driven edit only works because Brook\u2019s original photos suggest a hidden architecture inside the instruments.</p><figure><img src=\"https://www.404media.co/content/images/2025/06/Brooks-Fazioli-1.jpg\" width=\"2000\" height=\"631\"><figcaption><span>Left: </span><a href=\"https://www.charlesbrooks.info/\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><span>Charles Brooks original photograph</span></a><span>. Right: Grok's edited version of the photo. </span></figcaption></figure><p>He sells prints, posters, and calendars of the work. Referrals and social media posts drive traffic, but only if people know he\u2019s behind the photos. \u201cI want my images shared. That\u2019s important to me because that\u2019s how people find out about my work. But they need to be shared with my name. That\u2019s the critical thing,\u201d he said.</p><p>Brooks said he wasn\u2019t mad at Jiang for editing his photos, similar things have happened before. \u201cThe thing is that when Musk retweets it [\u2026] my name drops out of it completely because it was just there as a comment and so that chain is broken,\u201d he said. \u201cThe other thing is, because of the way Grok happens, this gets stamped with his watermark. And the way [Musk] phrases it, it makes it look like the entire image is created by AI, instead of 8 to 10 percent of it [\u2026] and everyone goes on saying, \u2018Oh, look how wonderful this AI is, isn\u2019t it doing amazing things?\u2019 And he gets some wonderful publicity for his business and I get lost.\u201d</p><p>He struggled with who to blame. Jiang did share Brooks\u2019 name, but putting it in a reply to the first tweet buried it. But what about the billionaire? \u201cIs it Musk? He\u2019s just retweeting something that did involve his software. But now it looks like it was involved to more of a degree than it was. Did he even check it? Was it just a trending post that one of his bots reposted?\u201d</p><p>Many people do not think while they post. Thoughts are captured in a moment, composed, published, and forgotten. The more you post the more careless you become with retweets and comments and Musk often posts more than 100 times a day.</p><p>\u201cI feel like, if he\u2019s plugging his own AI software, he has a duty of care to make sure that what he\u2019s posting is actually attributed correctly and is properly his,\u201d Brooks said. \u201cBut \u2018duty of care\u2019 and Musk are not words that seem to go together well recently.\u201d</p><p>When I spoke with him, Brooks had recently <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/mildlyinfuriating/comments/1l3pal7/elon_musk_shared_my_photos_without_credit/\"><u>posted a video</u></a> about the incident to r/mildlyinfuriating, a subreddit he said captured his mood. \u201cI\u2019m annoyed that my images are being used almost in their entirety, almost unaltered, to push an AI that is definitely disrupting and hurting a lot of the arts world,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not mad at AI in general. I\u2019m mad at the sort of people throwing this stuff around without a lot of care.\u201d</p><p>One of the ironies of the whole affair is that Brooks is not against the use of AI in art per se.&nbsp;</p><p>When he began taking photos, he mostly made portraits of musicians he\u2019d enhance with photoshop. \u201cI was doing all this stuff like, <a href=\"https://www.charlesbrooks.info/artists\"><u>let\u2019s make them fly</u></a>, let\u2019s make it look like their instrument\u2019s on fire and get all of this drama and fantasy out of it,\u201d he said.</p><p>When the first sets of AI tools rolled out a few years ago, he realized that soon they\u2019d be better at creating his composites than he was. \u201cI realized I needed to find something that AI can\u2019t do, and that maybe you don\u2019t want AI to do,\u201d he said. That\u2019s when he got the idea to use medical equipment to map the interiors of famous instruments.&nbsp;</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s art and I\u2019m selling it as art, but it\u2019s very documentative,\u201d he said. \u201cHere is the inside of this specific instrument. Look at these repairs. Look at these chisel marks from the original maker. Look at this history. AI might be able to do, very soon, a beautiful photo of what the inside of a violin might look like, but it\u2019s not going to be a specific instrument. It\u2019s going to be the average of all the violins it\u2019s ever seen [\u2026] so I think there\u2019s still room for photographers to work, maybe even more important now to work as documenters of real stuff.\u201d</p><p>This isn\u2019t the first time someone online has shared his work without attribution. He said that a year ago a CNN reporter tweeted one of his images and Brooks was able to contact the reporter and get him to edit the tweet to add his name. \u201cThe traffic surge from that was immense. He\u2019s an important reporter, but he\u2019s just a reporter. He\u2019s not Elon,\u201d Brooks said. He said he had seen a jump in traffic and interest since Elon\u2019s tweet, but it\u2019s nothing compared to when the reporter shared his work with his name.&nbsp;</p><p>\u201cYet my photos have been published on one of the most popular Twitter accounts there is.\u201d</p>",

          "content": "<p><em>This is Behind the Blog, where we share our behind-the-scenes thoughts about how a few of our top stories of the week came together. This week, we discuss the phrase \"activist reporter,\" waiting in line for a Switch 2, and teledildonics.</em></p><p><strong>JOSEPH: </strong>Recently our work on Flock, the automatic license plate reader (ALPR) company, produced some concrete impact. In mid-May <a href=\"https://www.404media.co/license-plate-reader-company-flock-is-building-a-massive-people-lookup-tool-leak-shows/\"><u>I revealed</u></a> that Flock was building a massive people search tool that would supplement its ALPR data with other information in order to \u201cjump from LPR to person.\u201d That is, identify the people associated with a vehicle and those associated with them. Flock planned to do this with public records like marriage licenses, and, most controversially, hacked data. This was according to leaked Slack chats, presentation slides, and audio we obtained. The leak specifically mentioned a hack of the Park Mobile app as the sort of breached data Flock might use.</p><p>After internal pressure in the company and our reporting, Flock ultimately decided to not use hacked data in Nova. We <a href=\"https://www.404media.co/flock-decides-not-to-use-hacked-data-in-people-search-tool/\"><u>covered the news last week here</u></a>. We also got audio of the meeting discussing this change. Flock published its own disingenuous blog post entitled <a href=\"https://www.flocksafety.com/articles/correcting-the-record-flock-nova-will-not-supply-dark-web-data\"><u>Correcting the Record: Flock Nova Will Not Supply Dark Web Data</u></a>, which attempted to discredit our reporting but didn\u2019t actually find any factual inaccuracies at all. It was a PR move, and the article and its impact obviously stand.</p><p>Something else was in the leaked audio of the meeting we got. A Flock executive described me as an \u201cactivist reporter.\u201d Here\u2019s the relevant passage:</p><p><em>Garrett [Flock\u2019s CEO is Garrett Langley] was talking about capabilities that were possible to use with Nova, not that we were necessarily going to implement when we use Nova. And in particular, one of those issues was around dark web data, would Flock be able to supply that to our law enforcement customers, to go solve really heinous crimes like internet crimes against children, child pornography, human trafficking. Some really horrible parts of society. And Garrett&nbsp; was looking at the potential of leveraging those tools. Unfortunately what happened is, in the course of these internal, private meetings that we have here at Flock, someone actually took that and leaked it to an activist reporter. If you\u2019ve seen some of the news that\u2019s been coming out over the last couple weeks, this same reporter is just circling around Flock, causing a lot of distraction, and frankly reporting on things that are just not totally true. There\u2019s maybe a hint of things that are true, of what\u2019s occurring, but it\u2019s not all there. And so, what I wanted to just say is that we took this concept of using dark web data in Nova and explored it, because investigators told us they wanted to do it.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em></p><p>To get the obvious bit out of the way: I am not an activist. I take my independence from everyone incredibly seriously, to the point where I end up annoying activists who provide me information. Over the years I have lost plenty of sources\u2014not sensitive ones, more like activists with tips\u2014because I decide to cover a particular story in my own way which I think is more accurate than how they describe it, or fair, or in the public interest; or I don\u2019t do promotion for whatever the activist\u2019s cause may be. One example: an activist said they would only provide me documents if I linked to their social media handles, and published my own tweets shouting them out. I said I always tell readers in the article where information is coming from to be transparent to them (unless it\u2019s a sensitive source I have to protect), but I did not do what they wanted with the social media shoutouts. It is not my role as a journalist to do social media marketing for an activist organization, or any organization. I wouldn\u2019t do it for law enforcement, I wouldn\u2019t do it for a cybersecurity company, and I wouldn\u2019t do it for an activist either. That is the sort of shit that happens in a paid advertisement, not a piece of journalism. It is vital to maintain this independence, regardless of who the person coming to you with a story is. I have since seen plenty of journalists posting links to activists\u2019 social media handles like the way described and it\u2019s always pretty eyebrow raising thinking if there was a transaction behind that. Journalists don\u2019t do deals. You have to not care about pissing people off, it\u2019s the cost of doing journalism.</p><p>A journalist makes a value judgement in choosing what to cover. They write an article because they think this issue is important, worth covering, important to highlight. This is a judgement and other journalists will come to other judgments. What is vital is that the reporting remains as fair and accurate as possible. I think covering Flock is important because it is a company and technology with a massive presence all across the U.S. and what they are doing is impacting policing, safety, surveillance (in good, bad, and complicated ways). It\u2019s really pretty simple.</p><p>Now on why I wanted to bring up this activist reporter comment. It is an attempt to discredit the coverage. If a reporter is actually an activist, with an agenda, they can\u2019t be trusted, and you shouldn\u2019t listen to them, right? Beyond, once again, Flock not finding any factual errors in our reporting, it reminded me of the other times attempts like this have come up over the years. I never talk about them because frankly, who cares, but maybe readers of Behind the Blog are interested. Way back when we were all at Motherboard, the technology section of VICE, me and my colleague Lorenzo Franceschi-Bicchierai <a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en/tag/when-spies-come-home/\"><u>wrote a series called <em>When Spies Come Home</em></u></a><em>. </em>It was all about the companies that sell spyware so people can \u2018catch their cheating spouses\u2019 (read: spy on their partners in an abusive relationship). One of the companies I covered in depth was Flexispy. I <a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en/article/meet-flexispy-the-company-getting-rich-selling-stalkerware-to-jealous-lovers/\"><u>wrote a profile about them here</u></a> based on data taken from the company by a hacker and given to me.</p><p>In response to that reporting, Flexispy published blog post after blog post about our work, us personally, and Motherboard as an outlet. Funnily, they would never call me a journalist. They constantly used the word \u201cblogger.\u201d Again, in an attempt to undermine the seriousness of the reporting. Flexispy never pointed to a factual inaccuracy, we never identified one, the reporting was solid, and parts of that series went on to be the catalyst <a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en/article/ftc-bans-retinax-from-selling-stalkerware/\"><u>for the FTC to ban another stalkerware company</u></a> from doing business.</p><p>This is all to say, journalists move from story to story, area of coverage to another company, etc. Right now, there is a public interest in covering Flock, that our stories on <a href=\"https://www.404media.co/ice-taps-into-nationwide-ai-enabled-camera-network-data-shows/\"><u>local police doing lookups for ICE</u></a> and a Texas cop using Flock to search nationwide for <a href=\"https://www.404media.co/a-texas-cop-searched-license-plate-cameras-nationwide-for-a-woman-who-got-an-abortion/\"><u>someone who got an abortion</u></a>, shows.</p><p><strong>JASON</strong>: Again, a couple things this week. I\u2019ll second everything in Joe\u2019s BTB above, cosigned. The Flock reporting is really important and we have taken great care to make sure everything is accurate. Now my real BTB: I\u2019ve gotten a lot of really nice feedback on my teachers article, which has been really nice. But to be honest I didn\u2019t write it! The article is almost entirely written by teachers themselves who sent me their feelings about generative AI in the classroom. It turns out teachers really can write! I did ask them questions and I did edit the article so that it wasn\u2019t 42,000 words long, but obviously all the writing was theirs. It just speaks to the really great community we\u2019ve built here and to the fact that our work has been able to get out there, and that feels really good.&nbsp;</p><p>Thing two: Last week, my Nintendo Switch broke, which was very devastating. I am a big right to repair/repair evangelist, and I probably will get my Switch fixed, but it also felt like a sign that I should get a Switch 2. I have never gotten any console at launch and figured I would try. I am in New Orleans right now at a business conference (lol, more on this in a second), so I went to a GameStop here and it was a really nice scene of superfans. Here\u2019s a short little video of me in line with a streamer I met, who was making his own little video. Very wholesome activity to participate in buying an expensive console the moment it comes out. I didn\u2019t have a preorder but they had plenty of them at GameStop, which either means the launch isn\u2019t going that well, or it means that Nintendo has been preparing for this for a long time and finally a console manufacturer figured out how to launch a new console without having terrible supply. Anyways my initial impressions of the Switch 2 is that it is a great, $500 device that plays the several-year-old indie games and state-of-the-art new roguelike deckbuilders slightly better than the old Switch played them. I am playing Monster Train 2 now, which is great so far. The card shuffling is so great in OLED. Seamless with the new processor. I was quite worried my stuff wouldn\u2019t port over because my old Switch is fully dead, but I was able to redownload my games and my saves after some clicking around on Nintendo\u2019s website. It was annoying but it did work. Switch is the only console I play anymore, and mostly either in bed or on airplanes. I\u2019ll be on a lot of airplanes coming up and just had to take a flight without one and it felt like the bad old days, so I\u2019m glad I\u2019m no longer switchless.</p><figure data-kg-thumbnail=\"https://www.404media.co/content/media/2025/06/IMG_2849_thumb.jpg\" data-kg-custom-thumbnail=\"\">\n            <div>\n                <video src=\"https://www.404media.co/content/media/2025/06/IMG_2849.mp4\" poster=\"https://img.spacergif.org/v1/720x1280/0a/spacer.png\" width=\"720\" height=\"1280\" preload=\"none\"></video>\n                <div>\n                    <button aria-label=\"Play video\">\n                        <svg viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\">\n                            <path d=\"M23.14 10.608 2.253.164A1.559 1.559 0 0 0 0 1.557v20.887a1.558 1.558 0 0 0 2.253 1.392L23.14 13.393a1.557 1.557 0 0 0 0-2.785Z\"></path>\n                        </svg>\n                    </button>\n                </div>\n                <div>\n                    <div>\n                        <button aria-label=\"Play video\">\n                            <svg viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\">\n                                <path d=\"M23.14 10.608 2.253.164A1.559 1.559 0 0 0 0 1.557v20.887a1.558 1.558 0 0 0 2.253 1.392L23.14 13.393a1.557 1.557 0 0 0 0-2.785Z\"></path>\n                            </svg>\n                        </button>\n                        <button aria-label=\"Pause video\">\n                            <svg viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\">\n                                <rect x=\"3\" y=\"1\" width=\"7\" height=\"22\" rx=\"1.5\" ry=\"1.5\"></rect>\n                                <rect x=\"14\" y=\"1\" width=\"7\" height=\"22\" rx=\"1.5\" ry=\"1.5\"></rect>\n                            </svg>\n                        </button>\n                        <span>0:00</span>\n                        <div>\n                            /<span>0:18</span>\n                        </div>\n                        <input type=\"range\" max=\"100\" value=\"0\">\n                        <button aria-label=\"Adjust playback speed\">1\u00d7</button>\n                        <button aria-label=\"Unmute\">\n                            <svg viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\">\n                                <path d=\"M15.189 2.021a9.728 9.728 0 0 0-7.924 4.85.249.249 0 0 1-.221.133H5.25a3 3 0 0 0-3 3v2a3 3 0 0 0 3 3h1.794a.249.249 0 0 1 .221.133 9.73 9.73 0 0 0 7.924 4.85h.06a1 1 0 0 0 1-1V3.02a1 1 0 0 0-1.06-.998Z\"></path>\n                            </svg>\n                        </button>\n                        <button aria-label=\"Mute\">\n                            <svg viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\">\n                                <path d=\"M16.177 4.3a.248.248 0 0 0 .073-.176v-1.1a1 1 0 0 0-1.061-1 9.728 9.728 0 0 0-7.924 4.85.249.249 0 0 1-.221.133H5.25a3 3 0 0 0-3 3v2a3 3 0 0 0 3 3h.114a.251.251 0 0 0 .177-.073ZM23.707 1.706A1 1 0 0 0 22.293.292l-22 22a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.414l.009.009a1 1 0 0 0 1.405-.009l6.63-6.631A.251.251 0 0 1 8.515 17a.245.245 0 0 1 .177.075 10.081 10.081 0 0 0 6.5 2.92 1 1 0 0 0 1.061-1V9.266a.247.247 0 0 1 .073-.176Z\"></path>\n                            </svg>\n                        </button>\n                        <input type=\"range\" max=\"100\" value=\"100\">\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            \n        </figure><p>Thing three: I\u2019m at a business conference (TM) in New Orleans right now. It\u2019s called the MediaPost Publishing Insider Summit and it is very very interesting to me. Basically it is the business people from a lot of publishers (Hearst, National Geographic, Daily Beast, New York Post, several others) talking about what they believe the future of journalism and the media business is, and the strategies they are deploying to get there. This is a type of job that existed at VICE and it is not something that was managed very well, to put it diplomatically. So it\u2019s kind of wild to now be at a conference where people in these roles talk about what they think is working and what they think is not working. Lots of it has to do with AI in various forms. Let\u2019s say uhh that I disagree with a lot of it, but that the amount of money you need to make to have a business succeed when you have tons of support roles, offices, businesspeople, etc is far different than what 404 Media needs to succeed. So I get that they are throwing things at the wall, and for all of our sakes I hope some of the non-AI stuff works.&nbsp;</p><p>There are also a lot of adtech companies here and publisher support companies (companies that build paywalls, do marketing campaigns, things like this). All of them are very nice people and some of their products seem genuinely useful, but, basically, I have been a journalist for 15 years and this is a world I knew existed but was never invited to. Being both a journalist and a business owner lets me in here (I am giving a talk tomorrow about 404 Media and journalist-owned media, and what traditional publishers can learn from us), and it\u2019s super interesting to actually be in a room like this. Don\u2019t worry, we are not going to deploy autoplaying video ads all over our website from one of the various purveyors of such tech who are here. I\u2019m not here shopping. I know I\u2019ve been vague in this little writeup but that\u2019s because I\u2019m only one day in and am dashing this off from the conference room and I want to see what the rest of the conference holds. I do hope to say more about this later and most of the conference is on the record, so I may write about it at some point.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>SAM</strong>: Some weeks I have absolutely nothing to say for a BTB and by noon on Friday I\u2019m looking around frantically like \u201c<a href=\"https://youtu.be/gId6nrMDmUU?si=xjpv00_kHvG1crA5\"><u>I love lamp</u></a>.\u201d Other times I have a little bit to say about a lot of things, which is usually Jason\u2019s style (including this week, called it), but I\u2019m going to go that route myself today.</p><p>Jason\u2019s story about TSA trying to build an AR grope machine made me think of the many many MANY efforts over the decades to create a long-distance augmented reality system for fucking. There was performance artist Dani Ploeger\u2019s \u201cB-hind\u201d (he drove a robot with an electrode in his asshole) which <a href=\"https://archive.is/deyxz\"><u>I wrote about for Vice</u></a>, which was inspired by another performance art piece from 1994 by Stelarc. In \u201cAmplified Body,\u201d Stelarc hooked himself up to industrial medical robots and other hardware controlled by electrical impulses from his muscles. The video is sick:&nbsp;</p><figure><iframe src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/50970875?app_id=122963\" width=\"368\" height=\"270\" title=\"Amplified Body by Stelarc (1994)\"></iframe></figure><p>Then there were <a href=\"https://archive.is/06ik2\"><u>these researchers</u></a> working on vision tracking for boob jobs, and going way back, <a href=\"https://patents.google.com/patent/US3875932A/en\"><u>Radio Dildo</u></a> in the 1970s, \u201c<a href=\"https://cs.stanford.edu/people/eroberts/cs181/projects/pornography/technology.htm\"><u>Robosuck</u></a>\u201d by Alan Hadazy, and sooooo many more examples that have had varying degrees of failure to total failure. Today we have things like Lovense sex toys that are controllable from afar, but nothing has really taken off in the AR space\u2014but companies like SexLikeReal are still trying, with VR/AR porn scenes that are pretty interesting. I devoted a whole chapter to teledildonics and these topics <a href=\"https://www.hachettebookgroup.com/titles/samantha-cole/how-sex-changed-the-internet-and-the-internet-changed-sex/9781523520145/?lens=workman-publishing-company\"><u>in my own book</u></a> if you\u2019re interested in this stuff; I think it\u2019s fun from a sex standpoint but because sex and porn are always pushing the limits of hardware and software, it\u2019s also just cool to see what crazy shit people were cooking in previous decades. One time Digital Playgrounds tried to make a tactic cybersex suit that they had to halt development on because it ran the risk of electrocuting people, which is a story in my book that I really loved.</p><p>Next thing: I cut a lot of extraneous excerpts/quotes/reading recommendations from the egg yolk popping story so I\u2019m gonna dump some of them here.&nbsp;</p><p>If you haven\u2019t read <a href=\"https://www.hachettebookgroup.com/titles/tina-horn/why-are-people-into-that/9780306832567/?lens=hachette-books\"><em><u>Why Are People Into That</u></em></a> by Tina Horn (or listened to the podcast) I highly recommend it. Early in the book she writes:</p><p><em>\u201cWe need a new code of sexual ethics based on imagination, curiosity, and communication. An ethic that abolishes the thought-policing (along with the long history of literal policing) of erotic ideas, fantasies, feelings, and tastes. Every person reading this has, at some point in their lives, felt a longing for an embodied experience of pleasure or particular configuration of companionship that was roundly suppressed by their inner cop. Who benefits from teaching us to repress ourselves? Only those who already have power and are terrified of yielding any measure of it. The social function performed by establishing what is clean and what is dirty has everything to do with shame and power; if people believed that while they are responsible for their actions, their feelings and fantasies are nothing to be ashamed of, they would be more difficult to control. It benefits the system of white supremacy for society to have a shared belief of what kind of person is civilized by their nature. It benefits the system of the patriarchy for society to have a shared belief of which ideas are pure and which feelings are perverted. It benefits the system of cis-heteronormativity for society to have a shared belief of what bodies make appropriate families, and what those families shouldn\u2019t be doing in both public and private spaces. And all of these beliefs are perpetuated through the bluntest tools of repression, oppression, and policing, along with the threat of violence and ostracism as punishment for transgressing.\u201d&nbsp;</em></p><p>Someone on Bluesky recommended these essays to me after I published the egg yolk principle: <a href=\"https://bloodknife.com/everyone-beautiful-no-one-horny/\"><u>Everyone Is Beautiful and No One Is Horny</u></a> by Raquel S. Benedict. It\u2019s such a good analysis of \u201csex symbols\u201d in film over the years, and how it\u2019s changed (for the more sterile). And <a href=\"https://specchioscuro.it/the-puritanical-eye-hyper-mediation-sex-on-film-and-the-disavowal-of-desire/\"><u>The Puritanical Eye: Hyper-mediation, Sex on Film, and the Disavowal of Desire</u></a> by Carlee Gomes:</p><p><em>\u201cThe use of market research, test screenings, and audience segmentation to identify \u2018the most profitable concepts\u2019 and target specific demographics, has led to a definitive homogenization of media and film. This is not a new phenomenon, but it is taking on a new shape in the digital age. In the past, the Monoculture referred to the middleclass, white American entertainment that dominated popular culture and media during the final peak of broadcast television. Today the Digital Monoculture operates with the same hegemonic forces, but with a different set of characters and characteristics, particularly those that thrive in a digital landscape of easily recognizable and instantly consumable reference points that can be taken in during the time it takes for something to pass your gaze mid-scroll. [...] So we\u2019re left with a landscape wherein films that are algorithmically deemed to have a higher chance of success are given more resources and marketing budgets, while riskier projects, projects that might appeal to a smaller number of people rather than the entirety of the four quadrants, are often ignored or underfunded, or go directly to streaming, or become serialized in some way. And sex scenes \u2013 and films like Basic Instinct and Showgirls in the 90s \u2013 don\u2019t appeal to the four quadrants, do they, if the four quadrants contain children as a key audience demographic lumped in with the rest of the movie-going public.\u201d&nbsp;</em></p><p>And one last recc for <a href=\"https://www.hachettebookgroup.com/titles/fancy-feast/naked/9781643752372/\"><em><u>Naked</u></em></a>, a memoir by Fancy Feast. She writes: </p><p><em>\u201cSex sells until the payment processer or credit card company you rely on decides that you\u2019re an undesirable party that no longer fits their corporate image and so you get banned or booted, locked out of your account, your assets frozen. Sex sells, but maybe not enough to gain access to a pension or health insurance. Sex sells, but not if the sex you\u2019re selling is your own.\u201d</em></p><p>And of course if you haven\u2019t read <a href=\"https://vexashley.medium.com/porn-on-tumblr-a-eulogy-love-letter-6d45e70fefff\"><u>Vex Ashley\u2019s eulogy for porn on Tumblr</u></a>, it\u2019s a must to understand more of the history of the burying of sex online.</p><p>Ok, last small thing then I\u2019m out, and this one\u2019s about Emanuel\u2019s story about AI boosters\u2019 attempts to render the whole Bible through an AI video generator. People on Bluesky were extremely rude, in a Richard Dawkins libbing-out sort of way, calling Christians stupid, gullible, etc. I agree with some of that, in the same way a lot of atheists or people of any religion are often stupid, gullible, etc., and have plentyyyyyyy of firsthand experience being very stupid, very Christian, and then pretty mean about religion at various points in my life. The Christian fandom frequently, aggressively sucks shit, I will be the first to tell you. But I thought Emanuel\u2019s story was respectful and level-headed about this AI Bible phenomenon, and he took the time to talk to very smart theologians and scholars about why this is happening. This to me is a great example of a 404 Story: taking something extremely weird and popular, and resisting the urge to point and go \u201clook at these morons,\u201d instead speaking to subject matter experts and explaining why it\u2019s popular and the history it\u2019s coming from. What has been will be again, what has been done will be done again; there is nothing new under the sun. Or something!&nbsp;</p>",

Yes, it's another week of major auction house sales, can you believe it? Phillips, Christie's, and Sotheby's do everything they can to maintain the attention of collectors during the Spring and early Summer months, touring the world and offering hundreds of watches, often heralding eye-watering results. We'll have a couple of picks from each of the upcoming sales here, along with one classic Bring A Loupe selection from eBay at a more reasonable price point.</p>\n  \t<p>But before all that, let's recap the results from last week's column. Our lead pick, the Patek Philippe Ellipse ref. 3938/101 has found a new home, marked as \"sold out\" \u2014 the asking price was <a href=\"https://foundwell.com/collections/antiques/products/18ct-patek-philippe-jumbo-ellipse#\" target=\"_blank\"><u>$27,995</u></a>. The Old England Queen Elizabeth Machin stamp watch sold on eBay for a best offer below <a href=\"https://www.ebay.com/itm/396649079186\" target=\"_blank\"><u>\u00a3190</u></a> \u2014 congratulations to the new owner, who is a BAL reader.

After an initial reaction of anger that I didn't include this rare, possibly specially commissioned, variant in Reference Points, I quickly settled down. The words 'rare' and 'Cartier' frequently find themselves in the same sentence, and, don't get me wrong, most of this is apt; however, finding something completely unknown is even more difficult still. Is the original London Crash rare?

This is a bit of a transitional piece because, as Phillips states in the catalog, the movement is the ETA 2512-1-based cal. 78-1 \u2014 \"correct\" for later Swiss-made cases, rather than the JLC calibers found in Tanks prior to 1972. I'm not surprised to see this discrepancy, if we can even call it that, as authenticating vintage Cartier is never so black and white.</p>\n  \t<figure>\n  <img alt=\"A Rolex Paul Newman daytona\" src=\"https://hodinkee.imgix.net/uploads/images/42e7bb8d-e298-480b-a9ec-c91cc4282111/BAL_6.6.2025_Phillips_1.jpg?ixlib=rails-1.1.0&amp;fm=jpg&amp;q=55&amp;auto=format&amp;usm=12&amp;ch=Width%2CDPR%2CSave-Data&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=2000\">\n  <figcaption><p><a href=\"https://www.phillips.com/detail/rolex/218255\" target=\"_blank\">Phillips - Lot 90 - 1969 Rolex Daytona \"Paul Newman\"</a>. <i>Image courtesy of Phillips.</i></p></figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n  \t<p>Speaking of which, the dial. Subverting the norm of the typical white dial, the black Roman numerals of the Cartier look are truly rare to see from the vintage period. Black-dialed Cartier London watches have gone quite crazy at auction, with a Baignoire Allong\u00e9e selling for <a href=\"https://www.phillips.com/detail/cartier/NY080124/99\" target=\"_blank\"><u>$387,350</u></a> last June, for example.

The estimate has been set modestly at $15,000 to $30,000.</p>\n  \t<p>Otherwise, at Phillips, if you were entirely new to vintage watches and obsessed with stainless steel, you could complete an ideal two-watch collection before the weekend was over. Both fresh to market, the 1969 Rolex Daytona ref. 6239 \"Paul Newman\" <a href=\"https://www.phillips.com/detail/rolex/218255\" target=\"_blank\"><u>(lot 90)</u></a> and the Patek Philippe Calatrava ref. 570 with a three-tone Breguet numeral dial <a href=\"https://www.phillips.com/detail/patek-philippe/219063\" target=\"_blank\"><u>(lot 95)</u></a> is all you would need.</p>\n  \t<figure>\n  <img alt=\"A Patek Philippe Ref. 570 with Breguet numerals\" src=\"https://hodinkee.imgix.net/uploads/images/400591b6-b922-4487-8e32-c5b9fc76e542/BAL_6.6.2025_Phillips_2.jpg?ixlib=rails-1.1.0&amp;fm=jpg&amp;q=55&amp;auto=format&amp;usm=12&amp;ch=Width%2CDPR%2CSave-Data&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=2000\">\n  <figcaption><p><a href=\"https://www.phillips.com/detail/patek-philippe/219063\" target=\"_blank\">Phillips - Lot 95 - Patek Philippe ref. 570 with three-tone Breguet numeral dial</a>. <i>Image courtesy of Phillips.</i></p></figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n  \t<p>The Newman is in great condition, complete with box and papers, and is consigned for sale by the original owner who received the watch as a graduation gift in 1970. The Patek was purchased by the consignor at an NAWCC \"mart\" in the early 2000s, although it is technically fresh to the public auction market. Three-tone Breguet dials are a bit of a thing.

Even before the Royal Oak, AP was a true master of complications, with a specific penchant for my favorite, calendars. Beginning in 1924, the brand produced a total of 48 triple calendar (or \"complete calendar\") watches in a rectangular case, similar to the one featured in <a href=\"https://www.christies.com/en/lot/lot-6539587\" target=\"_blank\"><u>lot 30</u></a>. The majority of these were signed only with the retailer through which the watch was sold, as Audemars Piguet was not really a \"brand\" quite yet. Of the 48 pieces, 22 were cased in white gold, the most common metal, and 17 were what AP called \"green gold\" at the time, which we now refer to as yellow gold. By my count, 12 of the 48 exist in the market today, 4 of which are \"green\" or yellow gold.</p>\n  \t<p>Presented in astonishingly honest vintage condition, this example boasts a ton of charm, thanks to the dark patina of the case. The dial also presents better in person than the catalog photos suggest. A white gold example sold at Phillips last year for CHF 120,650, having undergone a full dial and case restoration by Audemars Piguet. In contrast, Lot 30 presents itself in entirely original condition, making it a valuable market bellwether for assessing the premium placed on untouched versus restored items. Speaking of markets, the early AP market is suddenly hot after a couple of high results at Monaco Legend Group yesterday, as seen <a href=\"https://www.monacolegendauctions.com/auction/exclusive-timepieces-37/lot-113\" target=\"_blank\"><u>here</u></a> and <a href=\"https://www.monacolegendauctions.com/auction/exclusive-timepieces-37/lot-112\" target=\"_blank\"><u>here</u></a>.</p>\n  \t<figure>\n  <img alt=\"A military provenance Rolex Explorer\" src=\"https://hodinkee.imgix.net/uploads/images/1d229b0c-950f-4ea7-926a-e441c06d8994/BAL_6.6.2025_Christies_2.jpg?ixlib=rails-1.1.0&amp;fm=jpg&amp;q=55&amp;auto=format&amp;usm=12&amp;ch=Width%2CDPR%2CSave-Data&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=2000\">\n  <figcaption><p><a href=\"https://www.christies.com/en/lot/lot-6539597\" target=\"_blank\">Christie's - Lot 40 - 1956 Rolex Explorer ref. 6610</a>. <i>Image courtesy of Christie's.</i></p></figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n  \t<p>Also worth a look at Christie's is a pair of fresh-to-market 1950s Rolex Explorers, both reference 6610 with US military provenance. <a href=\"https://www.christies.com/en/lot/lot-6539597\" target=\"_blank\"><u>Lot 40</u></a>, a \"red depth\" dial variant, was consigned by the family of the original owner, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Lieutenant Colonel and Legion of Merit recipient Fayette L. Worthington. Lt. Col. Worthington graduated from the United States Military Academy at West Point in 1945. His service included duty in France, Manila, West Point, two tours in Vietnam, serving as Group Commander of the 555th in Germany, and as an Army General Staff Officer at the Pentagon. The watch was purchased in 1956, and Lt. Col. Worthington bought the \"stretch\" rivet Oyster bracelet to pair with it a few months later in 1957.

The Black Bat Squadron was often supported by the United States, particularly the CIA, in a top-secret manner.

From a storytelling perspective, the highlight has to be <a href=\"https://www.sothebys.com/en/buy/auction/2025/important-watches/a-platinum-and-diamond-set-keyless-wind-open-face\" target=\"_blank\"><u>lot 13</u></a>, Al Capone's Patek Philippe pocket watch from 1919. As a native Chicagoan, the story of Al Capone's 1920s crime empire has been ever-present in my life. While far less honorable than the Lieutenant Colonels mentioned above, Capone remains a notorious figure, recognized both in the U.S. and globally as one of history's most infamous criminals.</p>\n  \t<p>The 42mm pocket watch is custom-cased in platinum and adorned on the reverse with 90 single-cut diamonds spelling out his initials, 'AC,' in an Art Deco style. The dial has been left untouched as the watch is more of a piece of history than a horological object at this point. It is accompanied by a provenance letter from Capone's granddaughter, Barbara Mae Capone, and the estimate is $80,000 to $160,000.</p>\n  \t<figure>\n  <img alt=\"A Breguet Empire from 1969\" src=\"https://hodinkee.imgix.net/uploads/images/22dea123-b930-4246-8a5a-cf5b2abc907d/BAL_6.6.2025_Sothebys_1.jpg?ixlib=rails-1.1.0&amp;fm=jpg&amp;q=55&amp;auto=format&amp;usm=12&amp;ch=Width%2CDPR%2CSave-Data&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=2000\">\n  <figcaption><p><a href=\"https://www.sothebys.com/en/buy/auction/2025/important-watches/empire-a-rare-yellow-gold-automatic-wristwatch\" target=\"_blank\">Sotheby's - Lot 77 - 1969 Breguet Empire</a>. <i>Image courtesy of Sotheby's.</i></p></figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n  \t<p>Moving on, <a href=\"https://www.sothebys.com/en/buy/auction/2025/important-watches/empire-a-rare-yellow-gold-automatic-wristwatch\" target=\"_blank\"><u>lot 77</u></a> is my pick of the season \u2014 if I had some extra coin to bid on one watch (within reason), this is it. Breguet Empires have been the recipient of increasing attention lately as collectors prepare for the brand's 250th anniversary this year. In short, this would have been one of the finest classically styled time-only wristwatches available for purchase from the 1950s to the early 1970s.</p>\n  \t<p>The movement inside is the Swiss-made, chronometer-grade Peseux 260 \u2014 It's among the ultimate manually-wound calibers for both precision collectors and watchmakers. Breguet paired the exceptional Peseux 260 movement with a 35mm French-made case, elegant <i>pomme</i> hands, and a hand-crafted guilloch\u00e9 dial. In terms of craftsmanship, few time-only vintage watches come close. This example, consigned by the family of the original owner, remains in strong condition and carries an estimate of $40,000 to $80,000.</p>\n  \t<figure>\n  <img alt=\"A Patek minute repeater wristwatch\" src=\"https://hodinkee.imgix.net/uploads/images/ddea0b97-f849-4d12-8148-dbef9acaa785/BAL_6.6.2025_Sothebys_3.jpg?ixlib=rails-1.1.0&amp;fm=jpg&amp;q=55&amp;auto=format&amp;usm=12&amp;ch=Width%2CDPR%2CSave-Data&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=2000\">\n  <figcaption><p><a href=\"https://www.sothebys.com/en/buy/auction/2025/important-watches/reference-2524-1-retailed-by-guebelin-a-pink-gold\" target=\"_blank\">Sotheby's - Lot 20 - 1954 Patek Philippe ref. 2524/1 minute repeater</a>. <i>Image courtesy of Sotheby's.</i></p></figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n  \t<p>For all you big game hunters out there, you'll want to take a look at <a href=\"https://www.sothebys.com/en/buy/auction/2025/important-watches/reference-2524-1-retailed-by-guebelin-a-pink-gold\" target=\"_blank\"><u>lot 20</u></a>, a Patek Philippe ref. 2524/1 retailed by G\u00fcbelin. The 2524/1 is the ultimate expression of vintage Patek repeating wristwatches. Fewer than 50 were made in total, but only two examples of this metal, pink gold, are known to be on the market. At an estimate of $1.25M to $2.5M, it better be good.

This G\u00fcbelin Ipso-Day is just that. The Ipso-Day is an extension of G\u00fcbelin's in-house Ipso-Matic line, introduced in 1954 to commemorate the retailer's 100th anniversary. Featuring a Felsa Bidynator movement, an early full-rotor automatic, G\u00fcbelin wasn't simply slapping its brand name on a \"normal\" wristwatch and calling it a day. The Lucerne-based retailer had great taste in watches, so it should come as no surprise.</p>\n  \t<p>The \"Ipso-\" branding started there in '54 but quickly moved to other white-labeled wristwatches from the retailer. The Ipso-Vox alarm was essentially a JLC Memovox, for example. Here we have a later, 1970s, Ipso-Day, referring obviously to the date complication at three o'clock. On the German side of Switzerland, this dial design bears a resemblance to Junghans Max Bill. The case is stainless steel with a screw back and the movement should be a G\u00fcbelin-branded version of the ETA 2472. If you're looking for a vintage watch you can wear every day, you could do a whole lot worse than this.</p>\n  \t<figure>\n  <img alt=\"A 1970s G\u00fcbelin Ipso-Day\" src=\"https://hodinkee.imgix.net/uploads/images/f4f381a0-60fe-4032-91e1-1b3ba5b728fd/BAL_6.6.2025_Gubelin_2.jpg?ixlib=rails-1.1.0&amp;fm=jpg&amp;q=55&amp;auto=format&amp;usm=12&amp;ch=Width%2CDPR%2CSave-Data&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=2000\">\n  <figcaption></figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n  \t<p>An eBay seller in Chelsea, Michigan, has listed this G\u00fcbelin Ipso-Day on eBay for auction ending Saturday, June 7th at 4:12 PM ET.

Last year, I was captivated by the brand's first moon phase complication, the Classic Moon. This model is gorgeous, featuring a lunar complication rendered in aventurine glass by Murano artisans and engraved to replicate the shape of celestial bodies, complete with hand-applied paint and Super-LumiNova details. It's these elements that immediately draw you in, but I'd argue the staying power goes beyond the dial.</p>\n  \t<figure>\n  <img alt=\"Laurent Ferrier Classic Moon\" src=\"https://hodinkee.imgix.net/uploads/images/cc56bb0b-53a5-492a-9f53-eb7a07611324/20240411_LFClassicMoon_028.JPG?ixlib=rails-1.1.0&amp;fm=jpg&amp;q=55&amp;auto=format&amp;usm=12&amp;ch=Width%2CDPR%2CSave-Data&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=2000\">\n  <figcaption><p>The Laurent Ferrier Classic Moon. <i>Photo by Mark Kauzlarich.</i></p></figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n  \t<p>Flip any Laurent Ferrier model over, and you'll find the purity of design and beauty also lies within. The attention to detail and elegance go well past the elements put on display. What's inside the timepiece is just as important as what's on the outside. For the brand, each watch contains two universes that are equally valuable\u2014one that's visible to anyone who notices the timepiece on the wrist and one that's exclusive to the wearer.</p>\n  \t<figure>\n  <img alt=\"Laurent Ferrier\" src=\"https://hodinkee.imgix.net/uploads/images/4115b65f-f9d8-4157-887c-670407a9fe46/20240411_LFClassicMoon_065.JPG?ixlib=rails-1.1.0&amp;fm=jpg&amp;q=55&amp;auto=format&amp;usm=12&amp;ch=Width%2CDPR%2CSave-Data&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=2000\">\n  <figcaption><p>The movement of the Laurent Ferrier Classic Moon. <i>Photo by Mark Kauzlarich.</i></p></figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n  \t<p>Laurent Ferrier is among today's living watch industry legends. As a third-generation watchmaker, he's always believed in perpetuating the traditions of Swiss horology, but it would take time before he'd solidify his name in horological history.</p>\n  \t<p>Ferrier studied at the \u00c9cole d'Horlogerie de Gen\u00e8ve in the 1960s and, after completing his studies, joined Patek Philippe. He spent nearly four decades of his career dedicated to Patek, starting in the movement prototyping department. During that time, he contributed to projects such as the initial Nautilus and Aquanaut, eventually advancing to Director of Product Development. After a distinguished 37-year career, he left Patek, but instead of retiring, he launched his namesake brand at the age of 63.</p>\n  \t<figure>\n  <img alt=\"Laurent Ferrier Workshop\" src=\"https://hodinkee.imgix.net/uploads/images/6afec05c-29ca-4600-b9f6-68a887ad7e8a/R00003791_2200px.jpg?ixlib=rails-1.1.0&amp;fm=jpg&amp;q=55&amp;auto=format&amp;usm=12&amp;ch=Width%2CDPR%2CSave-Data&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=2000\">\n  <figcaption></figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n  \t  <figure>\n    <img src=\"https://hodinkee.imgix.net/uploads/images/0f83f1c2-6e5f-4ef9-aac0-752e1301a0ae/R00003541_2200px.jpg?ixlib=rails-1.1.0&amp;fm=jpg&amp;q=55&amp;auto=format&amp;usm=12&amp;ch=Width%2CDPR%2CSave-Data&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=2000\">\n    <figcaption></figcaption>\n  </figure>\n  <figure>\n    <img src=\"https://hodinkee.imgix.net/uploads/images/ca6b1a88-a51b-436c-a4eb-730820f0e98c/R00003771_2200px.jpg?ixlib=rails-1.1.0&amp;fm=jpg&amp;q=55&amp;auto=format&amp;usm=12&amp;ch=Width%2CDPR%2CSave-Data&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=2000\">\n    <figcaption></figcaption>\n  </figure>\n\n  \t<p>\"When I started my brand, I had in mind the quality that Patek upheld for its calibers,\" explains Mr. Ferrier. \"Every element of the movement to the case, dial, and hands\u2014the full watch was executed at the highest level at Patek. So, for me, this was naturally going to be the philosophy of my brand.\"</p>\n  \t  <figure>\n    <img src=\"https://hodinkee.imgix.net/uploads/images/e145ec61-a14b-4813-b6b4-a5b970426a36/R00003601_2200px.jpg?ixlib=rails-1.1.0&amp;fm=jpg&amp;q=55&amp;auto=format&amp;usm=12&amp;ch=Width%2CDPR%2CSave-Data&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=2000\">\n    <figcaption></figcaption>\n  </figure>\n  <figure>\n    <img src=\"https://hodinkee.imgix.net/uploads/images/24867551-d38e-4e47-8114-63b766186131/R00003571_2200px.jpg?ixlib=rails-1.1.0&amp;fm=jpg&amp;q=55&amp;auto=format&amp;usm=12&amp;ch=Width%2CDPR%2CSave-Data&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=2000\">\n    <figcaption></figcaption>\n  </figure>\n\n  \t<p>This impetus comes as no surprise. As far as finishing techniques go, Patek sets the bar\u2014it's something that's established the family-owned company as one of the most revered brands in the industry. From the case and dial to the beating heart of the movement, nearly every aspect has been completed with a human touch and the irreplaceable skill of hand-finishing executed by dedicated, trained specialists with talents passed down through generations.</p>\n  \t  <figure>\n    <img src=\"https://hodinkee.imgix.net/uploads/images/aadd0576-88a0-4f4a-9dbd-c09aa2eeeeee/LF_Workshop_GuitarfromClassictourbillon.jpg?ixlib=rails-1.1.0&amp;fm=jpg&amp;q=55&amp;auto=format&amp;usm=12&amp;ch=Width%2CDPR%2CSave-Data&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=2000\">\n    <figcaption><p><i>Photo courtesy Laurent Ferrier.</i></p></figcaption>\n  </figure>\n  <figure>\n    <img src=\"https://hodinkee.imgix.net/uploads/images/e2fc0d7d-47b1-4747-944d-9f1acfdf7a46/BarrelbridgefromtheClassicMoon.jpg?ixlib=rails-1.1.0&amp;fm=jpg&amp;q=55&amp;auto=format&amp;usm=12&amp;ch=Width%2CDPR%2CSave-Data&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=2000\">\n    <figcaption><p><i>Photo courtesy Laurent Ferrier.</i></p></figcaption>\n  </figure>\n\n  \t<p>These decorations enrich both the functionality and aesthetics of a timepiece. Finishing smooths away traces of machining that may impede perfect movement, hones edges that will touch against each other, protects against oxidation, and transforms dull metal into a material with alluring beauty. This is what sets hand-built, in-house movements apart from mass-produced calibers.</p>\n  \t<p>\"I wanted to push the boundaries even further,\" Mr. Ferrier says. \"Because we'd be producing much fewer pieces per year than at Patek, I knew we could achieve this.\"</p>\n  \t<figure>\n  <img alt=\"Laurent Ferrier Workshop\" src=\"https://hodinkee.imgix.net/uploads/images/c9b0a308-9963-4c08-9809-219bcb594f9a/R00003901_2200px.jpg?ixlib=rails-1.1.0&amp;fm=jpg&amp;q=55&amp;auto=format&amp;usm=12&amp;ch=Width%2CDPR%2CSave-Data&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=2000\">\n  <figcaption></figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n  \t<p>In addition to the knowledge gained throughout his tenure at Patek, Ferrier enlisted the help of his son, Christian, who spent years working in movement development and construction at Roger Dubuis before taking the role of Head of Brand Patrimony at his father's company.</p>\n  \t<p>\"When I began working with Christian to develop our first movements, it was crucial our finishing wasn't just practical but visually pleasing,\" shares Mr. Ferrier. \"Of course, at first, you must perfect the architecture, but if you don't see things through with that final step of great finishing, it doesn't make sense. Finishing is the last stamp you'll put on your creation before it's complete.\"</p>\n  \t<p>Today, each Laurent Ferrier movement is finished with more than 139 manual operations. There's one component that's always been a focus for the brand and created its so-called signature: the bridge.</p>\n  \t<figure>\n  <img alt=\"Laurent Ferrier Workshop\" src=\"https://hodinkee.imgix.net/uploads/images/d1c3fbfa-9da5-4bf2-bc51-8fe9d22d0e7e/R00004251_2200px.jpg?ixlib=rails-1.1.0&amp;fm=jpg&amp;q=55&amp;auto=format&amp;usm=12&amp;ch=Width%2CDPR%2CSave-Data&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=2000\">\n  <figcaption></figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n  \t<p>\"Developing the aesthetic of the bridge was one of the most important aspects to me,\" Mr. Ferrier continues. \"I wanted something soft and rounded, something attractive for the eyes. We don't do the best or most difficult finishing just because we can\u2014we do it because it's interesting and serves a purpose.\"</p>\n  \t<p>A form of beveling, also known by the French term anglage or chamfering, is a finishing technique that sets the standard for haute horlogerie movements. If you look at the flank of a bridge in one of Laurent Ferrier's calibers, there's a 45-degree angle that catches the light. This beveled detail is created through one of the most complex and time-consuming techniques. From a technical standpoint, anglage on the mainplates and bridges is believed to prevent material stress concentrations along their edges, and the first step is to remove scratches and burrs from the upper edge of a bridge.</p>\n  \t<figure>\n  <img alt=\"Laurent Ferrier Workshop\" src=\"https://hodinkee.imgix.net/uploads/images/ca91fbb4-1aad-4ab8-b02e-f76e2e6081d8/R00004191_2200px.jpg?ixlib=rails-1.1.0&amp;fm=jpg&amp;q=55&amp;auto=format&amp;usm=12&amp;ch=Width%2CDPR%2CSave-Data&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=2000\">\n  <figcaption></figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n  \t  <figure>\n    <img src=\"https://hodinkee.imgix.net/uploads/images/62912816-46ae-4786-88a5-a343be02651f/R00004311_2200px.jpg?ixlib=rails-1.1.0&amp;fm=jpg&amp;q=55&amp;auto=format&amp;usm=12&amp;ch=Width%2CDPR%2CSave-Data&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=2000\">\n    <figcaption><p>Small pieces of wood coated in very fine abrasive for polishing.&nbsp;</p></figcaption>\n  </figure>\n  <figure>\n    <img src=\"https://hodinkee.imgix.net/uploads/images/262b6739-291d-4149-9e4a-5701e0636ef5/R00004321_2200px.jpg?ixlib=rails-1.1.0&amp;fm=jpg&amp;q=55&amp;auto=format&amp;usm=12&amp;ch=Width%2CDPR%2CSave-Data&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=2000\">\n    <figcaption><p>Pieces of wood used for the final <i>anglage</i> polish.</p></figcaption>\n  </figure>\n\n  \t<p>Anglage is made more prominent by smoothing down with files and sometimes a micro rotor tool with an ebony tip along the edge to form a uniform width and two sharp parallel lines. The surface of the sloping angle is then hand-finished with files and wood pegs coated with abrasive paste, resulting in a polish that's incomparable to what can be achieved by machine. In a Ferrier movement, you'll also find interior polished angles with beveling. This time-consuming technique requires years of experience and a patient hand to make two polished chamfers match up precisely.</p>\n  \t<p>It's also becoming an increasingly rare skill due to the global shortage of watchmakers and horological artisans. According to the Employers' Convention of the Swiss Watch Industry, which oversees the training of watchmakers, Switzerland alone will need about 4,000 more watchmakers by 2026. When it comes to craftspeople who hold the caliber of training and experience to meet Laurent Ferrier's standards, the brand has felt the impact of this deficit in the workforce.</p>\n  \t<figure>\n  <img alt=\"Laurent Ferrier Workshop\" src=\"https://hodinkee.imgix.net/uploads/images/640cd3ee-0978-47ca-ada1-9565348796ac/R00003701_2200px.jpg?ixlib=rails-1.1.0&amp;fm=jpg&amp;q=55&amp;auto=format&amp;usm=12&amp;ch=Width%2CDPR%2CSave-Data&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=2000\">\n  <figcaption></figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n  \t<p>\"We've seen a decrease in trained decorators,\" says Mr. Ferrier. \"And many of those available need additional training to meet our quality, even those from big brands often lack the experience we require.

This is what makes us different\u2014we have the same high level of finishing on each component of each movement.

He realised that his progressive style of painting was at variance with both the Munich Academy and the critics, and in 1892 he took part in the foundation of the Munich Secession to bring change. The following year he co-founded the Free Association (Freie Vereinigung). He also expanded his skills, started etching in 1891, and lithography in 1894.</p>\n<p>Much of his painting during his nine years in Munich was experimental, although modern critics accuse him of spending more time drinking copious quantities of red wine and champagne.</p>\n<figure data-shortcode=\"caption\" id=\"attachment_18593\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-18593\"><a href=\"https://eclecticlight.co/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/corinthselfportraitskeleton1896.jpg\"><img data-attachment-id=\"18593\" data-permalink=\"https://eclecticlight.co/corinthselfportraitskeleton1896/\" data-orig-file=\"https://eclecticlight.co/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/corinthselfportraitskeleton1896.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"1524,1168\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"corinthselfportraitskeleton1896\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"<p>Lovis Corinth (1858\u20131925), Self-portrait with Skeleton (1896), oil on canvas, 66 \u00d7 86 cm , St\u00e4dtische Galerie im Lenbachhaus, Munich.

In this otherwise deserted countryside, with the winter drawing close, this painting could be read as indicating Corinth\u2019s bleak melancholy.

It shows the traditional station of the cross commemorating the lowering of the dead body of Christ from the cross, attended by Joseph of Arimathea and Mary Magdalene.</p>\n<p>This work is a thoroughly modern approach to its traditional theme, in its framing, composition, and faces. Its close-in cropped view suggests the influence of photography, and the faces shown appear contemporary and not in the least historic. These combine to give it the immediacy of a current event, rather than something that happened almost two millennia ago. Corinth returned to the subject of the Deposition, and the theme of the Crucifixion, in many of his later paintings.</p>\n<figure data-shortcode=\"caption\" id=\"attachment_18583\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-18583\"><a href=\"https://eclecticlight.co/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/corinthautumnflowers.jpg\"><img data-attachment-id=\"18583\" data-permalink=\"https://eclecticlight.co/corinthautumnflowers/\" data-orig-file=\"https://eclecticlight.co/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/corinthautumnflowers.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"674,1176\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"corinthautumnflowers\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"<p>Lovis Corinth (1858\u20131925), Autumn Flowers (1895), oil on canvas, 120 \u00d7 70 cm, Private collection.

Instead, the women are preparing a younger woman to attend a masked ball. Their subject has just got out of the wooden tub in the foreground, has been dried off, and is about to don the fine clothes laid over the chair at the left, including the black mask.</p>\n<p>Although Corinth undoubtedly drank more than his fair share of red wine and champagne while painting in Munich, his technique and style were maturing fast. The best of his paintings from this period are the equal of better-known works from later in his career. The stage was set for his first truly momentous painting.</p>\n<p><strong>References</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lovis_Corinth\" target=\"_blank\">Wikipedia</a>.</p>\n<p>Lemoine S et al.

          "content": "<p>An ambiguous city street, a freshly mown field, and a parked armoured vehicle were among the example photos we chose to challenge Large Language Models (LLMs) from OpenAI, Google, Anthropic, Mistral and xAI to geolocate.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Back in <a href=\"https://www.bellingcat.com/resources/2023/07/14/can-ai-chatbots-be-used-for-geolocation/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">July 2023</a>, Bellingcat analysed the geolocation performance of OpenAI and Google\u2019s models. Both chatbots struggled to identify images and were highly prone to hallucinations. However, since then, such models have rapidly evolved.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To assess how LLMs from OpenAI, Google, Anthropic, Mistral and xAI compare today, we ran 500 geolocation tests, with 20 models each analysing the same set of 25 images.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><div><img width=\"1200\" height=\"960\" src=\"https://www.bellingcat.com/app/uploads/2025/06/Untitled-design-1-1200x960.jpg\"></div><figcaption>We chose 25 of our own travel photos, varying in difficulty to geolocate, none of which had been published online before.</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Our analysis included older and \u201cdeep research\u201d versions of the models, to track how their geolocation capabilities have developed over time. We also included Google Lens to compare whether LLMs offer a genuine improvement over traditional reverse image search. While reverse image search tools work differently from LLMs, they remain one of the most effective ways to narrow down an image\u2019s location when starting from scratch.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>The Test</h2>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>We used 25 of our own travel photos, to test a range of outdoor scenes, both rural and urban areas, with and without identifiable landmarks such as buildings, mountains, signs or roads. These images were sourced from every continent, including Antarctica.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The vast majority have not been reproduced here, as we intend to continue using them to evaluate newer models as they are released. Publishing them here would compromise the integrity of future tests.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Each LLM was given a photo that had not been published online and contained no metadata. All models then received the same prompt: \u201cWhere was this photo taken?\u201d, alongside the image. If an LLM asked for more information, the response was identical: \u201cThere is no supporting information. Use this photo alone.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We tested the following models:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Developer</strong></td><td><strong>Model</strong></td><td><strong>Developer\u2019s Description</strong></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Anthropic</strong></td><td>Claude Haiku 3.5</td><td>\u201cfastest model for daily tasks\u201d</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Claude Sonnet 3.7</td><td>\u201cour most intelligent model yet\u201d</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Claude Sonnet 3.7 (extended thinking)</td><td>\u201cenhanced reasoning capabilities for complex tasks\u201d</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Claude Sonnet 4.0</td><td>\u201csmart, efficient model for everyday use\u201d</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Claude Opus 4.0</td><td>\u201cpowerful, large model for complex challenges\u201d</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Google</strong></td><td>Gemini 2.0 Flash</td><td>\u201cfor everyday tasks plus more features\u201d</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Gemini 2.5 Flash</td><td>\u201cuses advanced reasoning\u201d</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Gemini 2.5 Pro</td><td>\u201cbest for complex tasks\u201d</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Gemini Deep Research</td><td>\u201cget in-depth answers\u201d</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Mistral</strong></td><td>Pixtral Large</td><td>\u201cfrontier-level image understanding\u201d</td></tr><tr><td><strong>OpenAI</strong></td><td>ChatGPT 4o</td><td>\u201cgreat for most tasks\u201d</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>ChatGPT Deep Research</td><td>\u201cdesigned to perform in-depth, multi-step research using data on the public web\u201d</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>ChatGPT 4.5</td><td>\u201cgood for writing and exploring ideas\u201d</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>ChatGPT o3</td><td>\u201cuses advanced reasoning\u201d</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>ChatGPT o4-mini</td><td>\u201cfastest at advanced reasoning\u201d</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>ChatGPT o4-mini-high</td><td>\u201cgreat at coding and visual reasoning\u201d</td></tr><tr><td><strong>xAI</strong></td><td>Grok 3</td><td>\u201csmartest\u201d</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Grok 3 DeepSearch</td><td>\u201cadvanced search and reasoning\u201d</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Grok 3 DeeperSearch</td><td>\u201cextended search, more reasoning\u201d</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>This was not a comprehensive review of all available models, partly due to the speed at which new models and versions are currently being released. For example, we did not assess DeepSeek, as it currently only extracts text from images. Note that in ChatGPT, regardless of what model you select, the \u201cdeep research\u201d function is currently powered by a version of <a href=\"https://openai.com/index/introducing-deep-research/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">o4-mini</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gemini models have been released in \u201cpreview\u201d and \u201cexperimental\u201d formats, as well as dated versions like \u201c03-25\u201d and \u201c05-06\u201d. To keep the comparisons manageable, we grouped these variants under their respective base models, e.g. \u201cGemini 2.5 Pro\u201d.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We also compared every test with the first 10 results from Google Lens\u2019s \u201cvisual match\u201d feature, to assess the difficulty of the tests and the usefulness of LLMs in solving them.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We ranked all responses on a scale from 0 to 10, with 10 indicating an accurate and specific identification, such as a neighbourhood, trail, or landmark, and 0 indicating no attempt to identify the location at all.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>And the Winner is\u2026</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>ChatGPT beat Google Lens.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In our tests, ChatGPT o3, o4-mini, and o4-mini-high were the only models to outperform Google Lens in identifying the correct location, though not by a large margin. All other models were less effective when it came to geolocating our test photos.</p>\n\n\n\n<div data-src=\"visualisation/23466601\"></div>\n\n\n\n<p><em>We scored 20 models against 25 photos, rating each from 0 (red) to 10 (dark green) for accuracy in geolocating the images.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even Google\u2019s own LLM, Gemini, fared worse than Google Lens. Surprisingly, it also scored lower than xAI\u2019s Grok, despite Grok\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.404media.co/why-did-grok-start-talking-about-white-genocide/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">well-documented tendency to hallucinate.</a> Gemini\u2019s Deep Research mode scored roughly the same as the three Grok models we tested, with DeeperSearch proving the most effective of xAI\u2019s LLMs.<br><br>The highest-scoring models from Anthropic and Mistral lagged well behind their current competitors from OpenAI, Google, and xAI. In several cases, even Claude\u2019s most advanced models identified only the continent, while others were able to narrow their responses down to specific parts of a city. The latest Claude model, Opus 4, performed at a similar level to Gemini 2.5 Pro.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are some of the highlights from five of our tests.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>A Road in the Japanese Mountains</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The photo below was taken on the road between Takayama and Shirakawa in Japan. As well as the road and mountains, signs and buildings are also visible.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><div><img width=\"1200\" height=\"900\" src=\"https://www.bellingcat.com/app/uploads/2025/06/snowy-highway-Copy-1200x900.jpg\"></div><figcaption>Test \u201csnowy-highway\u201d depicted a road near Takayama, Japan.</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Gemini 2.5 Pro\u2019s response was not useful. It mentioned Japan, but also Europe, North and South America and Asia. It replied:</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cWithout any clear, identifiable landmarks, distinctive signage in a recognisable language, or unique architectural styles, it\u2019s very difficult to determine the exact country or specific location.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In contrast, o3 identified both the architectural style and signage, responding:</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cBest guess: a snowy mountain stretch of central-Honshu, Japan\u2014somewhere in the Nagano/Toyama area. (Japanese-style houses, kanji on the billboard, and typical expressway barriers give it away.)\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>A Field on the Swiss Plateau</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>This photo was taken near Zurich. It showed no easily recognisable features apart from the mountains in the distance. A reverse image search using Google Lens didn\u2019t immediately lead to Zurich. Without any context, identifying the location of this photo manually could take some time. So how did the LLMs fare?</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><div><img width=\"1200\" height=\"904\" src=\"https://www.bellingcat.com/app/uploads/2025/06/field-hills-Copy-1200x904.jpg\"></div><figcaption>Test \u201cfield-hills\u201d depicted a view of a field near Zurich</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Gemini 2.5 Pro stated that the photo showed scenery common to many parts of the world and that it couldn\u2019t narrow it down without additional context.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>By contrast, ChatGPT excelled at this test. o4-mini identified the \u201cJura foothills in northern Switzerland\u201d, while o4-mini-high placed the scene \u201dbetween Z\u00fcrich and the Jura mountains\u201d.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>These answers stood in stark contrast to those from Grok Deep Research, which, despite the visible mountains, confidently stated the photo was taken in the Netherlands. This conclusion appeared to be based on the Dutch name of the account used, \u201cFoeke Postma\u201d, with the model assuming the photo must have been taken there and calling it a \u201creasonable and well-supported inference\u201d.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>An Inner-City Alley Full of Visual Clues in Singapore</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>This photo of a narrow alleyway on Circular Road in Singapore provoked a wide range of responses from the LLMs and Google Lens, with scores ranging from 3 (nearby country) to 10 (correct location).</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><div><img width=\"903\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://www.bellingcat.com/app/uploads/2025/06/alley-903x1200.jpg\"></div><figcaption>Test \u201cdark-alley\u201d, a photo taken of an alleyway in Singapore</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The test served as a good example of how LLMs can outperform Google Lens by focusing on small details in a photo to identify the exact location. Those that answered correctly referenced the writing on the mailbox on the left in the foreground, which revealed the precise address.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While Google Lens returned results from all over Singapore and Malaysia, part of ChatGPT o4-mini\u2019s response read: \u201cThis appears to be a classic Singapore shophouse arcade \u2013 in fact, if you look at the mailboxes on the left you can just make out the label \u2018[correct address].\u2019\u201d&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some of the other models noticed the mailbox but could not read the address visible in the image, falsely inferring that it pointed to other locations. Gemini 2.5 Flash responded, \u201cThe design of the mailboxes on the left, particularly the \u2018G\u2019 for Geylang, points strongly towards Singapore.\u201d Another Gemini model, 2.5 Pro, spotted the mailbox but focused instead on what it interpreted as Thai script on a storefront, confidently answering: \u201cThe visual evidence strongly suggests the photo was taken in an alleyway in Thailand, likely in Bangkok.\u201d&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>The Costa Rican Coast</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the harder tests we gave the models to geolocate was a photo taken from Playa Longosta on the Pacific Coast of Costa Rica near Tamarindo.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><div><img width=\"1200\" height=\"900\" src=\"https://www.bellingcat.com/app/uploads/2025/06/beach-forest-1200x900.jpg\"></div><figcaption>Test \u201cbeach-forest\u201d showed Playa Longosta, Costa Rica.<br></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gemini and Claude performed the worst on this task, with most models either declining to guess or giving incorrect answers. Claude 3.7 Sonnet correctly identified Costa Rica but hedged with other locations, such as Southeast Asia. Grok was the only model to guess the exact location correctly, while several ChatGPT models (Deep Research, o3 and the o4-minis) guessed within 160km of the beach.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>An Armoured Vehicle on the Streets of Beirut</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>This photo was taken on the streets of Beirut and features several details useful for geolocation, including an emblem on the side of the armored personnel carrier and a partially visible Lebanese flag in the background.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><div><img width=\"721\" height=\"540\" src=\"https://www.bellingcat.com/app/uploads/2025/06/apc.jpg\"></div><figcaption>Test \u201cstreet-military\u201d depicted an armoured personnel carrier on the streets of Beirut</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Surprisingly, most models struggled with this test: Claude 4 Opus, billed as a \u201cpowerful, large model for complex challenges\u201d, guessed \u201csomewhere in Europe\u201d owing to the \u201cEuropean-style street furniture and building design\u201d, while Gemini and Grok could only narrow the location down to Lebanon. Half of the ChatGPT models responded with Beirut. Only two models, both ChatGPT, referenced the flag.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>So Have LLMs Finally Mastered Geolocation?</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>LLMs can certainly help researchers to spot the details that Google Lens or they themselves might miss.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One clear advantage of LLMs is their ability to search in multiple languages. They also<br>appear to make good use of small clues, such as vegetation, architectural styles or signage. In one test, a photo of a man wearing a life vest in front of a mountain range was correctly located because the model identified part of a company name on his vest and linked it to a nearby boat tour operator.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For touristic areas and scenic landscapes, Google Lens still outperformed most models. When shown a photo of Schluchsee lake in the Black Forest, Germany, Google Lens returned it as the top result, while ChatGPT was the only LLM to correctly identify the lake\u2019s name. In contrast, in urban settings, LLMs excelled at cross-referencing subtle details, whereas Google Lens tended to fixate on larger, similar-looking structures, such as buildings or ferris wheels, which appear in many other locations.</p>\n\n\n\n<div data-src=\"visualisation/23470918\"></div>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Heat map to show how each model performed on all 25 tests</em></p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Enhanced Reasoning Modes</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>You\u2019d assume turning on \u201cdeep research\u201d or \u201cextended thinking\u201d functions would have resulted in higher scores. However, on average, Claude and ChatGPT performed worse. Only one Grok model, DeeperSearch, and one Gemini, Gemini Deep Research, showed improvement. For example, ChatGPT Deep Research was shown a photo of a coastline and took nearly 13 minutes to produce an answer that was about 50km north of the correct location. Meanwhile, o4-mini-high responded in just 39 seconds and gave an answer 15km closer.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Overall, Gemini was more cautious than ChatGPT, but Claude was the most cautious of all. Claude\u2019s \u201cextended thinking\u201d mode made Sonnet even more conservative than the standard version. In some cases, the regular model would hazard a guess, albeit hedged in probabilistic terms, whereas with \u201cextended thinking\u201d enabled for the same test, it either declined to guess or offered only vague, region-level responses.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>LLMs Continue to Hallucinate</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>All the models, at some point, returned answers that were entirely wrong. ChatGPT was typically more confident than Gemini, often leading to better answers, but also more hallucinations.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The risk of hallucinations increased when the scenery was temporary or had changed over time. In one test, for instance, a beach photo showed a large hotel and a temporary ferris wheel (installed in 2024 and dismantled during winter). Many of the models consistently pointed to a different, more frequently photographed beach with a similar ride, despite clear differences.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Final Tips</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Your account and prompt history may bias results. In one case, when analysing a photo taken in the Coral Pink Sand Dunes State Park, Utah, ChatGPT o4-mini referenced previous conversations with the account holder: \u201cThe user mentioned Durango and Colorado earlier, so I suspect they might have posted a photo from a previous trip.\u201d&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Similarly, Grok appeared to draw on a user\u2019s Twitter profile, and past tweets, even without explicit prompts to do so.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Video comprehension also remains limited. Most LLMs cannot search for or watch video content, cutting off a rich source of location data. They also struggle with coordinates, often returning rough or simply incorrect responses.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ultimately, LLMs are no silver bullet. They still hallucinate, and when a photo lacks detail, geolocating it will still be difficult. That said, unlike our controlled tests, real-world investigations typically involve additional context. While Google Lens accepts only keywords, LLMs can be supplied with far richer information, making them more adaptable.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There is little doubt, at the rate they are evolving, LLMs will continue to play an increasingly significant role in open source research. And as newer models emerge, we will continue to test them.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Infographics by Logan Williams and Merel Zoet</em></p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.bellingcat.com/resources/how-tos/2025/06/06/have-llms-finally-mastered-geolocation/\">Have LLMs Finally Mastered Geolocation?</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.bellingcat.com\">bellingcat</a>.</p>",
